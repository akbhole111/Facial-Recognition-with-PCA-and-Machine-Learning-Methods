# Facial-Recognition-with-PCA-and-Machine-Learning-Methods
1. To analyze and compare the performance of different feature extraction methods and machine learning algorithms, such as SVMs and neural networks, in combination with PCA for facial recognition.
2. To investigate the impact of different factors, such as lighting conditions, pose, and demographic factors, on facial recognition performance and potential biases.
3. To develop and evaluate new preprocessing techniques and algorithms for improving the accuracy and efficiency of facial recognition with PCA and machine learning methods, particularly for large-scale datasets and real-time applications.
